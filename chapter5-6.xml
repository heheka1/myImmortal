            umtil I get five good revoiws! </note> </p>
         <p>Dumbledore made and <name ref="1">Draco</name> and I follow him. He kept shouting at us angrily. </p>
            <p> <said who="draco">“You ludacris fools!”</said> he shouted. </p>
           <p> I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face. Draco
            comforted me. When we went back to the castle Dumbledore took us to Professor Snape and
            Professor McGonagall who were both looking very angry.</p> 
         <p><said who="draco">“They were having sexual intercourse in the Forbidden Forest!”</said> he yelled in a furious voice.</p> 
            <p><said who="mcGpnagall">“Why did you do such a thing, you mediocre dunces?”</said> asked Professor McGonagall.</p> 
         <p><said who="snape">“How dare you?”</said> demanded Professor Snape. </p>
        <p> And then Draco shrieked. <said who="draco">“BECAUSE I LOVE HER!”</said></p> 
        <p> Everyone was quiet. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor 
         Snape said. <said who="snape">“Fine. Very well. You may go up to your rooms.”</said></p> 
         <p>Draco and I went upstairs while the teachers glared at us. </p>
         <p><said who="draco">“Are you okay, Ebony?”</said> Draco asked me gently.</p> 
         <p><said who="ebony">“Yeah I guess.”</said> I lied. I went to the girl’s dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair and changed 
            into a low-cut <rs type="fashion">black floor-length dress with red lace all around it and black high heels.</rs> When I 
            came out….</p> 
            <p>Draco was standing in front of the bathroom, and he started to sing ‘I just wanna live' by <name ref="2">Good 
            Charlotte</name>. I was so flattered, even though he wasn’t supposed to be there. We hugged and 
            kissed. After that, we said goodnight and he reluctantly went back into his room.</p>

         <p> <note>AN: shjt up prepz ok! PS I wnot update ubtil u give me goood revows!</note> </p>
         <p> The next day I woke up in my coffin. I put on<rs type="fashion"> a black miniskirt that was all ripped around the
            end and a matching top with red skulls all over it and high heeled boots that were black.</rs> I put
            on two pairs of skull earrings, and two crosses in my ears. I spray-painted my hair with purple. </p>
         <p> In the Great Hall, I ate some Count Chocula cereal with blood instead of milk, and a glass of 
            red blood. Suddenly someone bumped into me. All the blood spilled over my top. </p>
         <p> “Bastard!” I shouted angrily. I regretted saying it when I looked up cause I was looking into the 
            pale white face of a gothic boy with spiky black hair with red streaks in it. He was wearing so 
            much eyeliner that I was going down his face and he was wearing black lipstick. He didn’t have 
            glasses anymore and now he was wearing red contact lenses just like <name ref="1">Draco</name>’s and there was 
            no scar on his forhead anymore. He had a manly stubble on his chin. He had a sexy English 
            accent. He looked exactly like <name ref="4">Joel Madden.</name> He was so sexy that my body went all hot when I 
            saw him kind of like an erection only I’m a girl so I didn’t get one you sicko. </p>
         <p>“I’m so sorry.” he said in a shy voice.</p>
         <p> “That’s all right. What’s your name?” I questioned. </p>
         <p> “My name’s <name ref="3">Harry Potter</name>, although most people call me Vampire these days.” he grumbled. </p>
         <p>“Why?” I exclaimed.</p>
         <p> “Because I love the taste of human blood.” he giggled. </p>
         <p> “Well, I am a vampire.” I confessed. </p>
         <p> “Really?” he whimpered. </p>
         <p> “Yeah.” I roared. </p>
         <p> We sat down to talk for a while. Then <name ref="1">Draco</name> came up behind me and told me he had a surprise 
            for me so I went away with him. </p>
