                <h1>My Immortal Project</h1>
                <h2>What is My Immortal?</h2>
                <p>"My Immortal is a Harry Potter-based fan fiction serially published on FanFiction.net between 2006 and 2007. 
                    The story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named "Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way" 
                    and her relationships with the characters of the Harry Potter series, particularly her romantic relationship 
                    with Draco Malfoy, culminating in her travelling back in time to defeat the main antagonist of the series, 
                    ord Voldemort. The work takes its name from the song "My Immortal" by Evanescence. 
                    My Immortal is popularly regarded as one of the worst works of fan fiction ever written. 
                    Since the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its numerous grammar and spelling errors, 
                    plot inconsistencies and complete disregard for the original Harry Potter source material. 
                    The story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to fool and troll readers or to satirize fan fiction, 
                    but others consider the work and the alleged online presence of the author too elaborate to fake effectively. 
                    Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a YouTube web series, 
                    and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life. " -Wikipedia. You can find the version

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
     <p>Our mission is to analyze the word choice, mispellings, and slang of the fanfiction. We have done this by marking it up with XML through following
     the TEI guidelines. </p>
                <h2>Markup Stratedgy</h2>
                <h3>Unique Wording</h3>
                <p>When marking up My Immortal, we kept our eye out for specific things. Whenever we found slang, or a word that was misspelled,
                we would mark it with the "word" (w) tag. We then specified the proper way of spelling that word by adding the attribute "norm"
                inside the "word" tag (w norm="*correct spelling of the word*").</p>
                <h3>Characters</h3>
                <p>We also kept track of the characters within the story. We did this in various different ways. 
                    One way was by creating a XML id for each character, so whenever we found the character mentioned in the story, we would tag them with
                their unique id. In addition, whenever there was dialogue, we would mark who was speaking with the tag "said" and then use the attribute "who" 
                to indicate the speaker (said who"*person's name*"). We also created a character list that maps out all the characters mentioned, any nicknames 
                they have in the story, and mispellings of their names.</p>
